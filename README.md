## Installation

1 - Install the Sanity command line interface

```bash
$ npm i -g @sanity/cli
```

2 - Get to the `sanity` folder and initiate your own Sanity project in that folder

```bash
$ sanity init
```

3 - Add a CORS-origin rule to allow the frontend to request data

```bash
$ sanity cors add http://localhost:3000 --no-credentials
```

4 - Change your directory to `next` and rename the existing file named `.env.example` to `.env.local`. After that, open up the file and fill it in like the following.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=
SANITY_API_TOKEN=
```

> You can obtain NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET and NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID from the sanity/sanity.json file. In order to get SANITY_API_TOKEN, you need to log in to Sanity, and then navigate to your project. After that, you should be able to see your API Token under the bottom of the API tab.

5 - Get to the `next` folder and install frontend dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running locally

Run the Next.js project in development mode by using the following command

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

After that, you should be able to display the app on http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
